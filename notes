Had to install newer chrome driver version.

Use bricks to identify some sections.

Many tests assumes that the links on https://jobs.economist.com/ are actually correct.

Checks on sectors and search jobs are fairly naive, but get the job somewhat done:
  * Sectors.feature checks that the header at the top of the page is correct. Assumes page has loaded correctly if this is the case.
  * searchJob.feature just checks that the inputs are carried over and assumes page has loaded correctly if this is the case.
